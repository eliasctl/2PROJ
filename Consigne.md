## 1 - Introduction

Anblisoft, the world's leading video game publisher, seeks to acquire a development studio or to incorporate a team that will be able to provide them with an Age of War game to diversify their game portfolio.

Your team is in competition with several other subcontractors to do the development, the best project will win the contract. The primary objective of this project is to provide a first stable and saleable version that meets the stated specifications.

You are free to use any language and technology you want. You are obviously not allowed to copy or adapt an existing code. You are not allowed to use a no-code game-making App or an in-game map editor (in addition, blueprint-type tools must be highly restricted).

This project includes 2 specifications, you will make a choice between these 2 subjects/scales and will meet the expectations of the chosen one:

- The development-oriented subject
- The game-design oriented subject

Failure to comply with the above instructions or the delivery rules will result in a grade of 0.

## 2 - Presentation

Age of War is a mix between a defense game and a strategy game. The goal is to destroy the enemy base while defending yours. You can build turrets to defend your base and units to attack the enemy's. The twist of the game is that you can evolve as well as unlock new units and defense means. The more you evolve, the more you will become powerful.

### 2.1 - Units

Produce units to be sent to the enemy base by attacking anything in the path. You are limited to 10 units simultaneously. Producing units takes time, and a queue can be created.
There are 4 types of unit: Infantry, Support, Anti-Armor, Heavy. Each is more or less effective against a particular type.
They have different characteristics: Price, HP, Damage, Hit Speed, Build Time, Type, Walk Speed, and Range.
Killing an enemy unit gives gold and experience.

### 2.2 - Turrets

You can build up to 4 turrets on your base to defend yourself, each location costing money to unlock.
They have different characteristics: Price, Damage, Hit Speed, and Range. Selling a turret returns only 50% of the gold spent.

### 2.3 - Specials

Use experience to move (evolve) on to the next Age (there are 6 different ones).
You can also spend experience to use a power that will randomly hit units in the field (the more advanced the Age, the greater the damage and the greater the precision/strike). This power has a cooldown.

### 2.4 - Upgrades

You can upgrade a certain type of unit to make it more powerful and take the advantage in the fight.
There is an upgrade that unlocks a unit type initially locked at each Age (Heavy). It must be unlocked at each in order to invoke the corresponding unit.
The other upgrades are definitive, but each tier costs more and more. There are different ones: Infantry Damage, Support Damage, Anti-Armor Damage, Heavy Damage, Turret Damage, Support Range, Turret Range, Infantry HP, Anti-Armor HP, Heavy HP, Gold per Kill.

### 2.4 - Evolve

Evolving to the next Age requires a certain number of experience points. Once unlocked by a player, the game's background is changed. The evolving player unlocks new units, towers, and specials, increases base hit points, and gets a new base design.

### 2.5 - Considerations

The player wins if the enemy base drops to 0 HP. Support units always are range (and shoot as they walk). In the last Age, an ultimate unit is available.
The different Ages are Caveman, Spartan, Egyptian, Medieval, Renaissance, Modern, and Futuristic. You are free to choose your universe and your Ages as long as they are coherent and appropriate.

## 3 - Functional expression

### 3.1 - General

You will implement the game as specified in the previous section. Graphic quality, visual and sound environment, playability, and game balancing will be essential.

### 3.2 - AI and Local Mode

You will create a local game mode with 4 difficulty levels. Your AIs will certainly make better gameplay choices, but will also be helped by increased damage and HP, as well as more gold and experience earned.
In local mode, it will be possible to increase the game's speed.

### 3.3 - Internationalization

To meet market needs, your game will be available in at least 5 languages.

You will choose one of the 2 following subjects:

## 4 - [Subject 1] Development specifications

### 4.1 - Limits

The choice of this subject will limit you in the technologies: you will not be allowed to use any game engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine. You can propose a game that can be played via an executable or on a Web browser.

### 4.2 - Multiplayer

Two players on the same network can compete against each other.

## 4 - [Subject 2] Game-design specifications

### 4.1 - Limits

You are free to use any game engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine. You can propose a game that can be played via an executable or on a Web browser.

### 4.2 - Multiplayer

It is not about being connected to the same network and hosting a game on a player's computer, but about enjoying a fully online game. Players can create an online account to play with players from all over the world; they have a list of friends to exchange instant messages with and invite to games. It is also possible to search for opponents via matchmaking with an Elo rating system. Players have a profile with statistics and the ability to customize the profile picture based on the number of games and wins. Players in the game can exchange instant messages with each other.

## 5 - Delivery

Your rendering will be a ZIP containing your source codes, additional files (sounds, images, etc.), a user documentation, and a technical documentation explaining your choices and/or implementation choices/details.

The user documentation is a game manual, is intended for any user, and explains how to play. A user must have all the information to launch the game and understand all its details, rules, modes, etc.

The technical documentation is intended for professionals in the field and should describe in-depth the choices and implementations. It will contain at least the following elements:

- Justification of the choice of programming language and graphics library.
- Description of the data structures.
- AIs behavior.
- Physics management.
- Game design choices (statistics, unit/turret types, prices, etc.).
- Explanation of the processes used to manage the multiplayer games.
- etc.

Your rendering must contain an executable, an installer, or a link to launch the game easily for a normal user, on several architectures. Any rendering that requires heavy installation of additional software or advanced user manipulation will be considered as inadequate. A game that implements disparate features without creating a functional game will also not be considered a valid rendering.
